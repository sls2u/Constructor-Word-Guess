//Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. That means the constructor should define:

//
// An array of new Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word
// A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object (the first function defined in Letter.js) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.
// A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in Letter.js)

var Letter = require("./letter.js");
var inquirer = require('inquirer');

function Word(currentWord) {
// An array of new Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word
var letterOne = new Letter('a');
this.currentWord = [];
}
console.log(new Letter('a'));
