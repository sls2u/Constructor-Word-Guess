//Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:

// A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
// A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
// A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder (like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
// A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly

var inquirer = require('inquirer')
var [,,...userInput] = process.argv

function Letter(char) {
      //A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
      this.char = char.toUpperCase();
      //A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
      this.correctLetterGuessed = false;
      //A function that returns the underlying character if the letter has been guessed, or a placeholder
      //(like an underscore) if the letter has not been guessed
      this.revealChar = function() {
          if (this.correctLetterGuessed = true) {
              console.log(this.char);
          } else {
              console.log('-');
          }
      }
      //A function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character,
      //updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
      this.checkUserGuess = function() {
          if (this.char = userInput) {
              this.correctLetterGuessed = true;
              this.reavealChar();
          }
      }
  }
